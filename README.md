## About Legit
This is an interface to the GIT binary to make controlling it from within CL much easier. I've had the need to do this kind of thing a couple of times now, so I might as well encapsulate it into a proper library. I don't know if this is ever going to reach full coverage of all features given GIT's immense size, but I will add features as I need them.
